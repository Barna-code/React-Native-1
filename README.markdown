why react?
>>
## **************

There are more reasons why we want to use React. React helps us with a problem we'll encounter with normal JavaScript; the UI state becomes difficult to manage. In bigger JavaScript applications, you have to manually target elements in your DOM and if you then change the structure of your HTML code, chances are you will need to change the way you targeted your elements because you used querySelector.

Even if you use jQuery, traversing the DOM is easier, but it's still always something you have to keep in mind.

If you've got more complex web apps where you dynamically add and remove elements, this quickly can become cumbersome. In our course project, we build an app which is highly dynamic where we are able to build a burger and dynamically add and remove ingredients.

>> If you write this with normal JavaScript code, it's going to be a nightmare.

So React helps us by making the whole UI state management a non-issue.>>

It allows us to focus on our business logic instead of keeping our application from exploding.

Additionally, React is maintained by a big community.

So chances are, the React code is written better than we could have ever written it.

So therefore, it's highly-efficient and fast.

The bigger your application gets, the more this matters too.

Finally, React features a huge ecosystem and an extremely-active community which means that there is a great chance that for a given problem you face, you'll find a solution or an extra package you can add to fix it.

### REACT ALTERNATIVES:
There is also Angular and Vue.js as well as others like Backbone and Ember, but Angular and Vue are the most popular alternatives.

All three of them are great at creating highly-scalable web applications that look and feel good to the user.

jQuery is really only about traversing the DOM and targeting elements in the DOM.

$$ React is about just declaring what you see and focusing on the logic instead of focusing on the 'how'. Therefore, React, Angular and Vue allow you to create more powerful
 applications because you can focus on the logic and your business model and not so much on the technical side of actually reaching an element you want to change.
